## Edge Prediction with GNNs
To predict edges, you can use a framework that learns node embeddings and predicts the likelihood of an edge existing between two nodes.

### Steps:
Use a GNN to embed nodes based on their features and neighborhood information.
Use a scoring function (e.g., dot product, MLP) on node embeddings to predict edges.

### Models:

Graph Convolutional Network (GCN): Propagates information through the graph using node connections.
GraphSAGE: Extends GCN to inductively learn embeddings for unseen nodes.
Graph Attention Network (GAT): Uses attention mechanisms to weigh neighboring nodes differently.
Node2Vec: Generates embeddings using random walks, often used with a similarity-based approach for edge prediction.


## End-to-End Supervised Graph Prediction
This approach directly predicts the graph structure (adjacency matrix):

### Input: Node features.

### Output: An adjacency matrix representing predicted edges.

### Model:

Use a GNN with a decoder designed for edge reconstruction, such as a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE).
Train the model to minimize the difference between predicted and true adjacency matrices.


## Contrastive Learning for Graphs
If you have unlabeled data or need to pretrain a model, consider graph contrastive learning:

Learn node or graph embeddings by maximizing similarity between positive pairs (e.g., connected nodes) and minimizing similarity for negative pairs.
